  <p>Its probably the best pet i have ever had.His name is <em>Scooby</em>.He is a Dog.</P>
  <p>Unlike me he is always hyper and ready for any thing.He loves playing catch its infact  his best game.</p>
  <p>He also loves it so much when i take him out for a walk.</P>
    <p>Did i mention how great he looks,  no i bet i didnt,he is an Americam pit bull terrier.
       With the first glance you might think he is so fierce but he isnt.
       Although there are times when he really gets pissed off,like when hungry.<strong>I LOVE HIM ALOT</strong>.</p>
