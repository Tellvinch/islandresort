<h2><u>ABOUT ME</u></h2> 
</div class=first> 

<h2>My name is <strong>Tellvinch imani</strong>.I got my third name <em>'Sagina'</em> from my parents.
    This picture is not mine rather it portraits what i like.Personally am so much into fashion and
     style.I strongly believe that ones dressing says alot about them,thats why am always cautios about
    what i wear.Due to my great love for fashion,i decided to create a platform where people can get
    dressing tips and stay ahead in the fast moving fashion world.You should probably check the pages 
    out.The link is at the bottom of this page.The platform is called vinch collection.</h2>

<h2>I also love eating,<em>'something most people do' </em> but my love for food is out of this world.I eat
     everything except nothing.I guess by now you already know what turns me on.The one problem i have is 
     not growing fat even though i eat that much.I averagly take five meals a day plus some appetizers in 
     between you know,just to keep the flame burning. </h2>
