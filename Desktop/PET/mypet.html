  <p>Its probably the best toy i have ever had.His name is Scooby.He is a Dog.</P>
  <p>Unlike me he is always hyper and ready for any thing.He loves playing catch its infact  his best game.</p>
  <p>He also loves it so much when i take him out for a walk.</P>
    did i mention how great he looks,  no i bet i didnt,he is an Americam pit bull terrier.
    With the first glance you might think he is so fierce but he isnt.Although there are times when he really gets pissed off
    like when hungry.i love him alot.</<p>
